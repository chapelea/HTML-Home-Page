        Fallout 4 is a post-apocalyptic rpg. In Fallout 4, you are known
        as the "Sole Survivor". After a nuclear fallout has caused the world to go to heck in a handbasket,
        You and your infant son are the only survivors left, however while cryogenically frozen, to protect you from the fallout,
        someone kidnapped your boy. After awakening, it is now your destiny to traverse the wasteland in search of your lost son.
        Along the way, you may find that you aren't quite as alone as you thought...

        So about a year after the Xbox One came out, I had saved up enough money to buy myself one.
        I ordered one off Amazon, and when it came, it had a code for a free game, Fallout 4. It was free,
        so I gladly entered the code and downloaded the game. I was immediately hooked. Now some years later, Fallout 4 is still 
        my favorite video game, and I have over 1000 hours of playtime on it.
