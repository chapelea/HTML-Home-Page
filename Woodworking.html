        Woodworking is the process of making things out of, you guessed it, wood.

    <p>
        I have been around woodworkers all of my life. Growing up, my dad did cabinetry and carpentry. My mom's dad was also a carpenter.
        I remember being little and my dad coming home smelling like sawdust. It always made me so excited. There are pictures of me at
        two or three years old, out in the garage, helping my dad build something (or I thought I was) Now I can do all sorts of woodwoorking.
        I've made pens, rings, necklaces, wall art, signs, bences, tables, fishing lures, chess pieces, and I was even comissioned to make a dreidal once.
